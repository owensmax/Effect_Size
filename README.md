# Effect_Size
Code For "Recalibrating Expectations about Effect Size: A multi-method survey of effect sizes in the ABCD study"

All scripts require "es_varlist_622.txt" to be in the same directory. All R-scripts require the ABCD 2.0.1 RDS file to be present in the same directory. The jupyter notebook ("ES_script_RR_final.ipynb") requires "es_alphas.csv" to be present in the same directory. For the qualification regression script, you will need to have first run the jupyter notebook ("ES_script_preprint.ipynb") to produce "owens_updated.csv".
